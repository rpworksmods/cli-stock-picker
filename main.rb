def stock_picker(days)
  # Use reduce() to return two days in an array representing best day to buy and best day to sell
  # Best day to sell: lowest number in array
  # Best day to buy: highest number in array
  ### BUT!! - Must buy before selling!!! #####
  # Use array item's index to determine which day each price relates to (0,1,2,3,4 e.t.c.)
  
  

end

# Post-MVP:
# Beautify user input
# Request using gets in a user-friendly format:
# - Number of days: (To establish how many items in the array)
# - Loop through array and use gets to obtain price for that day
# - Calculate, and output results in a formatted way using dividers
